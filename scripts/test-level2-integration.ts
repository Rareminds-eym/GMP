// Test script to verify Level 2 Screen 3 integration with new column names
// This would be run in the browser console or as a test file

/*
TESTING CHECKLIST FOR NEW COLUMN NAMES:

1. Frontend Form Data â†’ Database Mapping
   - Fill out form fields
   - Check if data saves to correct stage-prefixed columns

2. Database â†’ Frontend Form Data Mapping  
   - Load saved progress
   - Verify form fields populate correctly

3. Stage Progress Tracking
   - Verify current_stage and completed_stages work
   - Check progress percentage calculation

4. File Upload (Stage 9)
   - Test file upload saves to stage9_prototype_file_data
   - Verify file name saves to stage9_prototype_file_name

SAMPLE TEST DATA:

const testFormData = {
  ideaStatement: 'I want to solve food waste for students by creating an app',
  problem: 'Food waste in college cafeterias',
  technology: 'Mobile app with AI prediction',
  collaboration: 'Student volunteers and staff',  
  creativity: 'Gamification with rewards',
  speedScale: 'Campus-wide deployment',
  impact: 'Environmental and cost savings',
  finalProblem: 'campus food waste',
  finalTechnology: 'AI prediction algorithms',
  finalCollaboration: 'dining services partnership',
  finalCreativity: 'point-based reward system',
  finalSpeedScale: 'scalable cloud infrastructure', 
  finalImpact: 'reduced waste and costs',
  reflection: 'Learned about user engagement',
  file: null
};

EXPECTED DATABASE STORAGE:
- stage1_idea_what: 'food waste'
- stage1_idea_who: 'students' 
- stage1_idea_how: 'creating an app'
- stage2_problem: 'Food waste in college cafeterias'
- stage3_technology: 'Mobile app with AI prediction'
- stage4_collaboration: 'Student volunteers and staff'
- stage5_creativity: 'Gamification with rewards'
- stage6_speed_scale: 'Campus-wide deployment'
- stage7_impact: 'Environmental and cost savings'
- stage8_final_problem: 'campus food waste'
- stage8_final_technology: 'AI prediction algorithms'
- stage8_final_collaboration: 'dining services partnership'
- stage8_final_creativity: 'point-based reward system'
- stage8_final_speed_scale: 'scalable cloud infrastructure'
- stage8_final_impact: 'reduced waste and costs'
- stage9_prototype_file_name: null (no file)
- stage9_prototype_file_data: null (no file)
- stage10_reflection: 'Learned about user engagement'

TESTING STEPS:

1. Navigate to Level 2 Screen 3
2. Fill out forms with test data above
3. Proceed through stages and save
4. Check database: 
   SELECT * FROM level2_screen3_progress WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
5. Refresh page and verify data loads correctly
6. Verify all form fields are populated with saved data

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
âœ… All form data saves to correct stage-prefixed columns
âœ… Saved data loads back into form correctly  
âœ… Progress tracking works (stages, percentage)
âœ… No console errors during save/load
âœ… Computed idea_statement field generates correctly
âœ… File upload stores in stage9 columns (when tested with file)
