# Timer Restoration Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The timer was not being restored when loading saved progress from the database. While the timer value was being saved correctly to the `total_time` field, it wasn't being loaded back when users returned to continue their progress.

## Root Cause
The progress restoration logic in the `restoreProgress()` function was restoring:
- ✅ Placed pieces (`setPlacedPieces`)
- ✅ Score (`setScore`)
- ✅ Health (`setHealth`) 
- ✅ Combo (`setCombo`)
- ❌ **Timer was missing** (`setTimer`)

## Solution Implemented
Added timer restoration logic to track and restore the maximum `total_time` value across all progress records for the user-module combination.

### Code Changes
**Location**: `restoreProgress()` function in useEffect (line ~569)

**Added Logic**:
```typescript
// Track the maximum total_time across all records
let maxTotalTime = 0;

data.forEach(progress => {
  // Track the maximum total_time across all records
  if (progress.total_time && progress.total_time > maxTotalTime) {
    maxTotalTime = progress.total_time;
  }
  
  // ... existing scenario restoration logic
});

// Restore the timer with the maximum total_time found
if (maxTotalTime > 0) {
  setTimer(maxTotalTime);
}
```

## Why Maximum Total Time?
The solution uses the **maximum `total_time`** across all progress records because:

1. **Continuous Timer**: The timer runs continuously across all scenarios in a module
2. **Multiple Records**: Each scenario creates its own database record with cumulative time
3. **Latest Time**: The highest `total_time` represents the most recent/complete time
4. **Scenario Progression**: Later scenarios will have higher total times

### Example Scenario:
```
Scenario 1 completed: total_time = 120 seconds
Scenario 2 completed: total_time = 240 seconds  ← Maximum (most recent)
Scenario 3 in progress: total_time = 300 seconds ← Maximum (current)
```

## Timer Behavior

### Before Fix:
1. User plays and completes scenarios → Timer saves correctly to database
2. User leaves and returns → **Timer resets to 0**
3. User continues → Timer starts from 0 (incorrect)
4. Final stats show incorrect total time

### After Fix:
1. User plays and completes scenarios → Timer saves correctly to database
2. User leaves and returns → **Timer restores to saved value**
3. User continues → Timer continues from correct time
4. Final stats show accurate total time

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **No Previous Progress**
```typescript
if (maxTotalTime > 0) {
  setTimer(maxTotalTime);
}
```
- If no progress exists, `maxTotalTime` remains 0
- Timer stays at default value (0)
- Normal behavior for new modules

### 2. **Multiple Incomplete Scenarios**
- Finds the maximum time across all records
- Ensures timer reflects the most recent session
- Handles complex progress states correctly

### 3. **Completed vs Incomplete Scenarios**
- Checks `total_time` from both completed and incomplete records
- Uses the highest value regardless of completion status
- Maintains timer continuity across scenario boundaries

## Database Schema Alignment
The fix properly uses the `total_time` field from the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE level3_progress (
  -- ... other fields
  total_time integer null,  -- ← This field is now properly restored
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Resume Incomplete Module
1. Start module, play for 2 minutes, quit mid-scenario
2. Return to module
3. **Expected**: Timer shows ~120 seconds and continues counting
4. **Before**: Timer showed 0 and started over

### Test Case 2: Resume After Completing Scenarios
1. Complete 3 scenarios (total 5 minutes), quit
2. Return to module
3. **Expected**: Timer shows ~300 seconds and continues for remaining scenarios
4. **Before**: Timer showed 0 and started over

### Test Case 3: View Completed Module Stats
1. Complete all scenarios (total 8 minutes)
2. Return to module (shows FinalStatsPopup)
3. **Expected**: Final stats show correct 8-minute total time
4. **Before**: Final stats showed incorrect time

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Accurate Time Tracking**
- Users see correct elapsed time when resuming
- Final statistics show accurate completion times
- Time-based achievements work correctly

### 2. **Consistent User Experience**
- Timer continues seamlessly across sessions
- No confusion about progress timing
- Proper feedback on time efficiency

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Database time values are properly utilized
- No data loss on session interruption
- Consistent time tracking across all scenarios

### 4. **Performance Metrics**
- Leaderboards show accurate completion times
- Time-based comparisons work correctly
- Analytics reflect true user engagement time

## Result
The timer now properly restores from saved progress, ensuring users see accurate elapsed time when resuming modules and providing correct time data in final statistics and leaderboards.
