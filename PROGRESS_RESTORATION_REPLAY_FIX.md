# Progress Restoration Replay Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When using "Play Again" to retry a game, the progress restoration logic was interfering with the clean reset. Instead of starting fresh, the game was loading previous scenario states, causing scenarios to appear in the wrong order or with incorrect completion states.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Progress Restoration Triggering During Replay
The progress restoration useEffect had dependencies that caused it to run during replay:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // This would run when scenarios were loaded during replay
  async function restoreProgress() {
    // Would restore previous game state instead of allowing clean reset
  }
}, [user?.id, currentModule, scenarios?.length]); // scenarios?.length triggered during replay
```

### Issue 2: No Replay Mode Awareness
The progress restoration logic couldn't differentiate between:
- **Initial game load**: Should restore previous progress
- **Replay reset**: Should start completely fresh

### Issue 3: Race Condition
During replay reset:
1. Game state reset to clean values
2. Scenarios loaded (triggers progress restoration useEffect)
3. Progress restoration overwrote clean reset with old data
4. Result: Scenarios appeared in wrong state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replay Mode Detection**
Added checks to skip progress restoration during replay:
```typescript
// Skip progress restoration if we're in replay mode or have already checked progress
if (!user?.id || !currentModule) {
  setIsInitializing(false);
  return;
}

if (isReplayMode) {
  console.log("üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - in replay mode");
  setIsInitializing(false);
  return;
}

if (hasCheckedProgress) {
  console.log("üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - already checked");
  setIsInitializing(false);
  return;
}
```

### 2. **Updated Dependencies**
Added replay mode and progress check flags to useEffect dependencies:
```typescript
}, [user?.id, currentModule, scenarios?.length, isReplayMode, hasCheckedProgress]);
```

### 3. **Clear Logging**
Added console logs to track when progress restoration is skipped:
- `"üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - in replay mode"`
- `"üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - already checked"`

## State Flow Comparison

### Before Fix (Broken)
```
Play Again Clicked
    ‚Üì
Reset game state (clean)
    ‚Üì
Scenarios loaded
    ‚Üì
Progress restoration useEffect triggered
    ‚Üì
Old progress data restored (overwrites clean reset)
    ‚Üì
Scenarios appear in wrong state ‚ùå
```

### After Fix (Working)
```
Play Again Clicked
    ‚Üì
setIsReplayMode(true)
    ‚Üì
Reset game state (clean)
    ‚Üì
Scenarios loaded
    ‚Üì
Progress restoration useEffect checks isReplayMode
    ‚Üì
Progress restoration skipped
    ‚Üì
Clean reset preserved
    ‚Üì
First scenario appears correctly ‚úÖ
```

## Implementation Details

### Progress Restoration Conditions
```typescript
// All conditions must be false for progress restoration to run
!user?.id                    // User not authenticated
|| !currentModule            // Module not loaded
|| isReplayMode              // In replay mode (SKIP)
|| hasCheckedProgress        // Already checked progress (SKIP)
```

### Replay Mode Lifecycle
```typescript
// 1. Normal game load
isReplayMode = false         // Allow progress restoration
hasCheckedProgress = false   // Allow progress restoration

// 2. Play Again clicked
setIsReplayMode(true)        // Block progress restoration
setHasCheckedProgress(true)  // Block progress restoration

// 3. After replay setup
setIsReplayMode(false)       // Reset for next time
// hasCheckedProgress stays true to prevent re-restoration
```

### Initial State Values
```typescript
const [isInitializing, setIsInitializing] = useState(true);
const [hasCheckedProgress, setHasCheckedProgress] = useState(false);  // Allow initial restoration
const [isReplayMode, setIsReplayMode] = useState(false);              // Allow initial restoration
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Clean Replay Experience**
- Play Again starts completely fresh
- No interference from previous game state
- Scenarios appear in correct order (first scenario first)

### 2. **Preserved Normal Flow**
- Initial game load still restores progress correctly
- Existing functionality unaffected
- Users can continue interrupted games

### 3. **Clear State Separation**
- Normal game flow vs replay flow clearly differentiated
- Predictable behavior in both scenarios
- No unexpected state mixing

### 4. **Debugging Support**
```typescript
console.log("üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - in replay mode");
console.log("üîÑ Skipping progress restoration - already checked");
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Initial Game Load (Normal Flow)
1. User opens game for first time
2. **Expected**: Progress restoration runs, loads any existing progress ‚úÖ
3. **Expected**: Game continues from where user left off ‚úÖ

### Play Again (Replay Flow)
1. User completes module and clicks "Play Again"
2. **Expected**: Progress restoration skipped ‚úÖ
3. **Expected**: Game starts from first scenario ‚úÖ
4. **Expected**: All state is clean (score=0, health=100, etc.) ‚úÖ

### Multiple Replays
1. User plays again multiple times
2. **Expected**: Each replay starts fresh ‚úÖ
3. **Expected**: No accumulation of old state ‚úÖ

### Return After Replay
1. User plays again, then refreshes browser
2. **Expected**: Normal progress restoration works ‚úÖ
3. **Expected**: Can continue from current progress ‚úÖ

## Error Prevention

### Race Condition Handling
- Progress restoration blocked during replay setup
- Clean state preserved until replay is complete
- No timing-dependent behavior

### State Consistency
- Clear flags indicate when to skip restoration
- Multiple safeguards prevent accidental restoration
- Predictable state transitions

### Memory Management
- No accumulation of old progress data
- Clean reset prevents memory leaks
- Efficient state management

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Conditional Progress Restoration**
Only runs when appropriate, not during replay.

### 2. **State Flag Management**
Clear flags control when restoration should occur.

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**
Easy to debug and understand what's happening.

### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
Normal game flow completely preserved.

The fix ensures that "Play Again" provides a truly clean gaming experience while preserving the ability to restore progress during normal game loads.
