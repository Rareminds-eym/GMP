# Comprehensive Scoring System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a sophisticated scoring system that calculates scenario scores based on three key factors: correct piece placement, health maintenance, and combo performance. This provides a more balanced and engaging scoring mechanism.

## Scoring Formula

### Total Score = Placement Score (60%) + Health Score (25%) + Combo Score (15%)

```typescript
const calculateScenarioScore = (
  correctPlacements: number,
  totalPieces: number,
  currentHealth: number,
  currentCombo: number,
  maxCombo: number
): number => {
  // Base score from correct placements (60% weight)
  const placementScore = totalPieces > 0 ? (correctPlacements / totalPieces) * 60 : 0;
  
  // Health bonus (25% weight) - reward maintaining high health
  const healthScore = (currentHealth / 100) * 25;
  
  // Combo bonus (15% weight) - reward consistent performance
  const comboScore = maxCombo > 0 ? (currentCombo / maxCombo) * 15 : 0;
  
  // Calculate final score and round to nearest integer
  const finalScore = Math.round(placementScore + healthScore + comboScore);
  
  // Cap at 100 points maximum
  return Math.min(finalScore, 100);
};
```

## Scoring Components

### 1. Placement Score (60% Weight)
**Purpose**: Rewards correct piece placement accuracy
**Calculation**: `(correctPlacements / totalPieces) * 60`
**Range**: 0-60 points

**Examples**:
- 5/5 correct placements = 60 points
- 4/5 correct placements = 48 points  
- 3/5 correct placements = 36 points

### 2. Health Score (25% Weight)
**Purpose**: Rewards maintaining high health throughout the scenario
**Calculation**: `(currentHealth / 100) * 25`
**Range**: 0-25 points

**Examples**:
- 100 health = 25 points
- 85 health = 21.25 points
- 70 health = 17.5 points
- 55 health = 13.75 points

### 3. Combo Score (15% Weight)
**Purpose**: Rewards consistent correct placements without mistakes
**Calculation**: `(currentCombo / maxCombo) * 15`
**Range**: 0-15 points

**Examples**:
- Perfect combo (5/5) = 15 points
- 4-combo streak = 12 points
- 3-combo streak = 9 points
- Broken combo (0) = 0 points

## Scoring Examples

### Perfect Performance
- **Placements**: 5/5 correct = 60 points
- **Health**: 100/100 = 25 points  
- **Combo**: 5/5 streak = 15 points
- **Total**: 100 points ‚≠ê

### Good Performance
- **Placements**: 5/5 correct = 60 points
- **Health**: 85/100 = 21.25 points
- **Combo**: 4/5 streak = 12 points
- **Total**: 93 points

### Average Performance
- **Placements**: 4/5 correct = 48 points
- **Health**: 70/100 = 17.5 points
- **Combo**: 3/5 streak = 9 points
- **Total**: 75 points

### Poor Performance
- **Placements**: 3/5 correct = 36 points
- **Health**: 55/100 = 13.75 points
- **Combo**: 0/5 streak = 0 points
- **Total**: 50 points

## Dynamic Score Updates

### On Correct Placement
1. **Increment** correct placement counter
2. **Increment** combo counter
3. **Recalculate** score using new values
4. **Maintain** current health

### On Incorrect Placement
1. **Reduce** health by 15 points
2. **Reset** combo to 0
3. **Recalculate** score with reduced health and broken combo
4. **Maintain** correct placement counter

## Implementation Details

### Real-time Score Calculation
```typescript
// On correct placement
const newCorrectPlacements = correctPlacementIndex + 1;
const newCombo = combo + 1;
const totalCorrectPieces = correctViolations.length + correctActions.length;

const newScore = calculateScenarioScore(
  newCorrectPlacements,
  totalCorrectPieces,
  health,
  newCombo,
  totalCorrectPieces // maxPossibleCombo
);

// On incorrect placement
const newHealth = Math.max(0, health - 15);
const newCombo = 0; // Reset combo

const recalculatedScore = calculateScenarioScore(
  correctPlacementIndex, // No change in correct placements
  totalCorrectPieces,
  newHealth,
  newCombo,
  totalCorrectPieces
);
```

### Score Persistence
- Score is saved to database after every placement (correct or incorrect)
- Final scenario score is stored when scenario completes
- Score contributes to overall module statistics

## Benefits of New System

### 1. **Balanced Scoring**
- No single factor dominates the score
- Rewards multiple aspects of performance
- Encourages strategic thinking

### 2. **Progressive Difficulty**
- Health management becomes crucial
- Combo maintenance adds challenge
- Placement accuracy remains primary focus

### 3. **Engaging Gameplay**
- Players must balance speed vs accuracy
- Health preservation becomes strategic
- Combo streaks provide satisfaction

### 4. **Fair Assessment**
- Accounts for different play styles
- Rewards consistent performance
- Penalizes careless mistakes appropriately

## Strategic Implications

### For Players
1. **Accuracy First**: Correct placements provide the most points
2. **Health Management**: Avoid unnecessary mistakes to preserve health bonus
3. **Combo Preservation**: Maintain streaks for maximum combo bonus
4. **Risk Assessment**: Balance speed vs accuracy for optimal scores

### For Game Balance
1. **Skill Differentiation**: Separates novice from expert players
2. **Replayability**: Multiple scoring factors encourage replay
3. **Learning Curve**: Gradual improvement across all scoring dimensions
4. **Competitive Element**: Clear performance metrics for comparison

## Score Display

### In-Game Feedback
- Real-time score updates after each placement
- Visual feedback for score changes
- Clear indication of scoring factors

### Final Statistics
- Detailed breakdown of score components
- Comparison with previous attempts
- Overall module performance metrics

The comprehensive scoring system provides a more engaging and balanced gameplay experience while accurately reflecting player skill across multiple performance dimensions.
