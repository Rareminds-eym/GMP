# Timer Control Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The timer was running continuously from the moment the component loaded, including when the scenario popup was open and the user wasn't actually playing. This resulted in inaccurate time tracking that included time spent reading scenario descriptions.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Timer Started Too Early
The timer useEffect started the timer immediately when the component mounted:
```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEM: Timer starts immediately
useEffect(() => {
  if (!timerRef.current) {
    timerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      setTimer((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }
}, [showFinalStats]);
```

### Issue 2: No Gameplay State Awareness
The timer didn't differentiate between:
- **Reading time**: User reading scenario description (should not count)
- **Playing time**: User actively placing pieces (should count)
- **Pause time**: User in menus or dialogs (should not count)

### Issue 3: Inaccurate Time Tracking
This led to inflated time measurements that included:
- Time spent reading scenario descriptions
- Time spent in pause states
- Time spent in dialog boxes
- Time before user actually started playing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Gameplay-Based Timer Control**
Updated the timer to start only during active gameplay:

```typescript
// Timer effect: start when gameplay begins (scenario closed), stop when all scenarios complete
useEffect(() => {
  // Start timer only when user is actively playing (scenario dialog closed and not showing final stats)
  const shouldRunTimer = !showScenario && !showFinalStats && !isComplete && scenarios && scenarios.length > 0;
  
  if (shouldRunTimer && !timerRef.current) {
    console.log('⏱️ Starting gameplay timer');
    timerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      setTimer((prev) => prev + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }
  
  // Stop timer when scenario dialog is open, final stats are shown, or scenario is complete
  if ((!shouldRunTimer || showFinalStats) && timerRef.current) {
    console.log('⏱️ Stopping gameplay timer');
    clearInterval(timerRef.current);
    timerRef.current = null;
  }

  return () => {
    if (timerRef.current) {
      clearInterval(timerRef.current);
      timerRef.current = null;
    }
  };
}, [showScenario, showFinalStats, isComplete, scenarios]);
```

### 2. **Timer Start Conditions**
The timer now starts only when ALL conditions are met:
- `!showScenario`: Scenario dialog is closed
- `!showFinalStats`: Final stats popup is not shown
- `!isComplete`: Current scenario is not complete
- `scenarios && scenarios.length > 0`: Scenarios are loaded

### 3. **Timer Stop Conditions**
The timer stops when ANY condition is met:
- `showScenario`: Scenario dialog is open
- `showFinalStats`: Final stats popup is shown
- `isComplete`: Current scenario is complete

### 4. **Removed Premature Timer Start**
Updated the replay logic to not start the timer immediately:

```typescript
// Show first scenario after state reset (timer will start when scenario is closed)
setTimeout(() => {
  // Don't start timer here - it will start automatically when user closes scenario dialog
  console.log("⏱️ Timer will start when user closes scenario dialog and begins playing");
  
  // Show scenario dialog
  setShowScenario(true);
}, 200);
```

## Timer Behavior Flow

### Before Fix (Inaccurate)
```
Component loads
    ↓
Timer starts immediately ❌
    ↓
User reads scenario (timer running) ❌
    ↓
User closes scenario dialog (timer still running)
    ↓
User plays game (timer running) ✅
    ↓
Result: Time includes reading time ❌
```

### After Fix (Accurate)
```
Component loads
    ↓
Timer does not start ✅
    ↓
User reads scenario (no timer) ✅
    ↓
User closes scenario dialog
    ↓
Timer starts ✅
    ↓
User plays game (timer running) ✅
    ↓
Result: Time includes only gameplay ✅
```

## State-Based Timer Control

### Timer Running States ✅
- **Active Gameplay**: Scenario closed, user placing pieces
- **Between Scenarios**: Moving from one scenario to next (continuous timing)

### Timer Stopped States ✅
- **Reading Scenario**: Scenario dialog open
- **Final Stats**: Module completed, showing results
- **Scenario Complete**: Individual scenario finished
- **Component Loading**: Before scenarios are loaded

## Implementation Details

### Timer Start Logic
```typescript
const shouldRunTimer = !showScenario && !showFinalStats && !isComplete && scenarios && scenarios.length > 0;

if (shouldRunTimer && !timerRef.current) {
  console.log('⏱️ Starting gameplay timer');
  timerRef.current = setInterval(() => {
    setTimer((prev) => prev + 1);
  }, 1000);
}
```

### Timer Stop Logic
```typescript
if ((!shouldRunTimer || showFinalStats) && timerRef.current) {
  console.log('⏱️ Stopping gameplay timer');
  clearInterval(timerRef.current);
  timerRef.current = null;
}
```

### Dependencies
```typescript
}, [showScenario, showFinalStats, isComplete, scenarios]);
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Accurate Time Tracking**
- Only counts time spent actively playing
- Excludes reading and pause time
- Provides meaningful gameplay duration metrics

### 2. **Fair Performance Comparison**
- Users who read scenarios carefully aren't penalized
- Time-based leaderboards reflect actual gameplay speed
- Consistent timing across different play styles

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- Users can take time to read scenarios without pressure
- Timer reflects actual engagement with gameplay
- More intuitive timing behavior

### 4. **Improved Analytics**
- Accurate gameplay duration data
- Better understanding of actual play time
- More meaningful performance metrics

## Console Output

### Timer Start
```
⏱️ Starting gameplay timer
```

### Timer Stop
```
⏱️ Stopping gameplay timer
```

### Replay Timer Info
```
⏱️ Timer will start when user closes scenario dialog and begins playing
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Normal Gameplay Flow
1. Load game → Timer not running ✅
2. Read scenario → Timer not running ✅
3. Close scenario → Timer starts ✅
4. Play game → Timer running ✅
5. Complete scenario → Timer stops briefly ✅
6. Next scenario → Timer resumes ✅

### Replay Flow
1. Click "Play Again" → Timer resets to 0 ✅
2. First scenario shows → Timer not running ✅
3. Close scenario → Timer starts ✅
4. Play game → Timer running ✅

### Pause Scenarios
1. Playing game → Timer running ✅
2. Open any dialog → Timer stops ✅
3. Close dialog → Timer resumes ✅

## Expected Time Measurements

### Before Fix
- **Total time**: 8:30 (includes 3:00 reading + 5:30 playing)
- **Accuracy**: Poor (inflated by reading time)

### After Fix
- **Total time**: 5:30 (only actual gameplay)
- **Accuracy**: Excellent (pure gameplay time)

The timer now accurately reflects only the time spent actively playing the game, providing meaningful performance metrics and fair comparisons between users.
