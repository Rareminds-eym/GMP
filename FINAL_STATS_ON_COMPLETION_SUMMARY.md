# Final Stats Popup on Last Scenario Completion

## Problem
The FinalStatsPopup was only shown when the victory popup was closed via `handleVictoryClose`. This meant users had to manually close the victory popup to see their final stats, even when completing the last scenario.

## Solution
Modified the completion logic to automatically show the FinalStatsPopup when the last scenario is completed, providing a seamless transition from scenario completion to final results.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Last Scenario Detection
**Location**: `handleDrop` function (line ~906)

**Added Logic**:
```typescript
// Set completion state with delay for UX
if (isScenarioComplete) {
  // Check if this is the last scenario
  const isLastScenario = scenarioIndex >= (scenarios?.length ?? 0) - 1;
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setIsComplete(true);
    
    // If this is the last scenario, show final stats after victory popup
    if (isLastScenario) {
      // Add the current scenario result to the results array
      const currentResult = {
        score: newScore,
        combo: newCombo,
        health,
        scenarioIndex,
      };
      const updatedResults = [...scenarioResults, currentResult];
      setScenarioResults(updatedResults);
      
      // Show final stats after a brief delay to let victory popup show first
      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsComplete(false);
        setShowFinalStats(true);
      }, 2000); // 2 second delay to show victory popup first
    }
  }, 400);
}
```

### 2. Updated Victory Close Handler
**Location**: `handleVictoryClose` function (line ~1048)

**Before**: Always checked for last scenario and showed final stats
**After**: Only handles non-final scenarios since final stats are shown automatically

```typescript
// Check if this was the last scenario
const isLastScenario = scenarioIndex >= (scenarios?.length ?? 0) - 1;

if (isLastScenario) {
  // Final stats are already being shown from handleDrop
  // Just close the victory popup
  setIsComplete(false);
} else {
  // Move to next scenario (timer continues running)
  // ... existing logic for next scenario
}
```

### 3. Updated Dependencies
**Location**: `handleDrop` useCallback dependencies (line ~997)

**Added**: `scenarios?.length` and `health` to the dependency array since they're now used in the function.

## User Experience Flow

### Before:
1. User completes last scenario
2. Victory popup shows
3. User must click to close victory popup
4. Final stats popup shows

### After:
1. User completes last scenario
2. Victory popup shows briefly (2 seconds)
3. **Automatically transitions to final stats popup**
4. Seamless experience without manual intervention

## Technical Details

### Timing Sequence:
1. **Last piece placed** (t=0ms): Scenario marked as completed in database
2. **Victory popup shows** (t=400ms): Brief celebration display
3. **Final stats popup shows** (t=2400ms): Automatic transition to results

### State Management:
- `scenarioResults` is updated with the final scenario result
- `setIsComplete(false)` hides the victory popup
- `setShowFinalStats(true)` shows the final stats popup
- No manual user interaction required

### Database Consistency:
- Last scenario is still saved as completed immediately when last piece is placed
- Scenario results array is updated with all completed scenarios
- Final stats calculation uses the complete results array

## Benefits

1. **Seamless UX**: Automatic transition from completion to final results
2. **No Manual Steps**: Users don't need to close victory popup manually
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Final stats shown right after completion
4. **Consistent Timing**: Predictable 2-second delay for victory celebration
5. **Complete Data**: All scenario results are included in final stats

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Non-final scenarios**: Still show victory popup that user can close manually
2. **Final scenario**: Automatic transition to final stats
3. **State consistency**: Victory popup properly closed before final stats show
4. **Data integrity**: All scenario results properly collected and displayed

The final stats popup now appears automatically when the last scenario is completed, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.
