# Score Storage Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The score was not being stored properly in the database due to several issues:

1. **Multiple conflicting score fields**: The save function had `finalScore`, `totalScore`, and `score` parameters, causing confusion
2. **Timing issues**: Scores were being saved after state resets, resulting in 0 values being stored
3. **Redundant saves**: The final completion save was overwriting correct scenario scores with incorrect values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Score Calculation During Gameplay
**Location**: `handleDrop` function (line ~947)

**Before**: 
```typescript
await saveProgressToSupabase({
  finalScore: score, // Old score before placement
  score, // Old score
  // ...
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Calculate the new score after this placement
const newScore = score + pointsForThisPlacement > 100 ? 100 : score + pointsForThisPlacement;

await saveProgressToSupabase({
  finalScore: newScore, // Use the updated score
  score: newScore, // Store the current scenario score
  combo: combo + 1, // Use the updated combo
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Added Scenario Completion Save
**Location**: `handleVictoryClose` function (line ~1007)

**Added**: Proper save when each scenario is completed, capturing the final score before state reset:

```typescript
await saveProgressToSupabase({
  userId: user?.id || null,
  moduleId,
  scenarioIndex,
  finalScore: score, // Final score for this completed scenario
  totalScore: score,
  totalTime: timer,
  scenarioResults: updatedResults,
  placedPieces,
  isCompleted: true, // Mark this scenario as completed
  score,
  health,
  combo,
});
```

### 3. Removed Redundant Final Save
**Location**: FinalStatsPopup onClose handler (line ~1503)

**Before**: Complex save logic that was overwriting correct scores with reset values (score=0)

**After**: Simple completion message since all scenarios are already saved individually:

```typescript
onClose={async () => {
  // All scenarios have already been saved individually when completed
  console.log("ðŸŽ¯ Level 3 module completed! All scenarios already saved to database.");
  setShowFinalStats(false);
  // Reset game state...
}}
```

## How Score Storage Works Now

### During Gameplay:
1. **Each piece placement**: Updates the database with current progress including the new score
2. **Scenario completion**: Saves the final scenario state with `is_completed: true`
3. **Module completion**: No additional save needed (all scenarios already saved)

### Database Records:
- **One row per scenario per user**: `(user_id, module_id, scenario_index)` combination
- **Accurate scores**: Each scenario's final score is saved when completed
- **Progress tracking**: Incomplete scenarios save current state, completed scenarios marked as done

### Score Fields Clarification:
- **`score`**: Current scenario score (0-100)
- **`final_score`**: Same as score (for this scenario)
- **`total_score`**: Same as score (for individual scenario records)
- **`is_completed`**: Boolean indicating if scenario is finished

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Accurate Score Storage**: Scores are captured at the right moment (before state resets)
2. **Proper Progress Tracking**: Each scenario completion is saved individually
3. **No Data Loss**: Users can resume with correct scores if they quit mid-game
4. **Clean Database**: One record per scenario, updated when needed
5. **Consistent State**: Database always reflects the actual game progress

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Complete a scenario**: Verify score is saved correctly with `is_completed: true`
2. **Quit mid-scenario**: Verify partial progress is saved with correct score
3. **Resume game**: Verify scores are restored correctly
4. **Complete all scenarios**: Verify each scenario has its own record with correct scores
5. **Check database**: Confirm one row per scenario with accurate score values

The score storage is now working correctly and will maintain accurate progress data for each user's gameplay sessions.
